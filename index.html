                            <p class="mb-0"><br>Your digital world begins with your computer booting into its operating system. Almost everything you do runs on top of an operating system such as Windows, MacOS, or Linux.<br><br></p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>Let's start with the most popular desktop operating system: Microsoft's Windows. Overall, Windows is a good choice for balancing hardware capabilities with application availability, but it falls short in terms of privacy. In terms of privacy, it is commonly known that Windows follows you and acts as spyware. At one point, they even gave over encrypted messages to the NSA.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Apple MacOS</h2>
                    <p>Apple's MacOS is the company's next major operating system. Is it safer than Windows? In terms of privacy, Apple states that all personal data is handled on the actual device rather than on an Apple server. In actuality, user information is "anonymized" before being delivered to Apple's servers. So Apple does build a profile of you and your activities, but it's not directly linked to your own iCloud account. The problem is that items may be readily linked together, especially when Apple has access to your data. In only the first half of 2015, Apple released and surrendered information on iCloud customers over 2,000 times. Between Windows and MacOS, MacOS provides more privacy and security than Windows.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Linux Os</h2>
                    <p>The third main operating system version is Linux, which is based on the open source Linux kernel and serves as a basis for a variety of operating systems known as linux distributions, ranging from Ubuntu to redstarOS.</p>
                    <p>Privacy on Linux distributions will vary depending on the distribution, although it is substantially more private than Windows or MacOS. Even the more popular distros that came under criticism for privacy concerns had small issues in contrast to what Apple and Microsoft did. For individuals who are new to Linux, popular solutions such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint make the transition simple while still providing enough protection and privacy. Fedora and Debian are good choices for intermediate and advanced users.</p><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/0x0.jpg">
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Berkeley Software Distribution<br></h2>
                    <p>BSD, or Berkeley Software Distribution, is the final major operating system to be discussed. The two most prevalent variations are FreeBSD and OpenBSD, which will feel comparable to most Linux distributions with some under-the-hood variances and licence concerns.</p>
